}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{Expression count matrix with rows corresponding to genes and
columns corresponding to cells.}

\item{ccluster}{The cluster approach: give \code{labeled} and corporate with
param \code{label} (see details in \code{label}) if the cells are labeled;
give a specific number and a spectral clustering approach chosen from
\code{specc, Spectrum} otherwise; and of cause you can use your own cluster
method and give us a function with a matrix as input and a vector as output
Default is \code{c(8,"specc")}.}

\item{label}{Cell cluster labels which can be a vector, data.frame, matrix
with one row or one column, and etc (will only be used when \code{ccluster}
is set to \code{labeled}). Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{normalized}{Whether the \code{counts} is raw or not. \code{FALSE} for
raw and \code{TRUE} for not. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{S_G}{Gene latent matrix with \code{D} rows and the columns
corresponding to genes. Default is \code{NULL} which means no Gene latent
matrix.}

\item{S_C}{Cell latent matrix with \code{D} rows and the columns
corresponding to cells. Default is \code{NULL} which means no cell latent
matrix.}

\item{D}{Dimension of the latent factor. Default is \code{32}.}

\item{totalepoch}{Total number of epochs. Default is \code{300}.}

\item{burnin}{Number of burn-in epochs which are only be used as running
Markov chain. Default is \code{200}.}

\item{sn_max}{Maximum adaptive precision. Default is \code{10}.}

\item{sn_init}{Initial adaptive precision. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{threshold}{The threshold on dropout probabilities. Default is \code{0.5}.}

\item{ncores}{Number of cores to use. Default is \code{5}.}

\item{out_dir}{The path and folder to store the results. Default is
\code{"./Bfimpute/"}.}

\item{out_name}{The file name which Bfimpute will save as. Default is
\code{"Bfimpute"}.}

\item{out_type}{The file type which Bfimpute will save as: "csv", "txt",
"rds", and "all" for all the three types, or "none" for just returning
without saving. Default is \code{"all"}.}
}
\value{
Bfimpute returns the imputed matrix with the same dimension as
\code{counts}. And it also saves the imputed count matrix to the specific
direction with specific name and types (depending on \code{out_dir},
\code{out_name}, and \code{out_type}).

\description{
Uses Bfimpute to recover drop-out events
}
\details{
Bfimpute is a powerful imputation tool for scRNA-seq data that
recovers the dropout event by factorizing the count matrix into the product
of gene-specific and cell-specific feature matrices. Bfimpute uses full
Bayesian inference to describe the latent information for genes and cells
and carries out a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme which is able to easily
incorporates side information to train the model and perform the imputation.
